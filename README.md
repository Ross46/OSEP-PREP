# Intro:
---
I am a Masters Student in information Security, with keen interest in infrastructure security. Worked as an intern, Volunteer and Freelancer for a couple of companies. Participated in CTF's, solved boxes in HTB, TryHackMe, Proving Grounds, etc. I would design home labs to test and practice, but never worked with Active Directory prior to OSEP. I got my OSCP in February 2021, did not work anywhere or practiced as I was focusing on my masters application and preparing to move out. I jumped directly in OSEP in November and as time goes by, I am here Writing my post OSEP experience. Everybody has their own path and experience
